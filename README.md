# Kristoffer's Portfolio
> A collection of new knowledge in web development as an intern. 

This project will be used as a journal to record my learning career as an intern in [insert company here] under Mr./Mrs [insert name here]. You can grab a copy and use it in anyway you like.

## Installing / Getting started
If you're using windows [this](jekyll-windows.juthilo.com) is what I follow to correctly install Jekyll on windows otherwise download and install Jekyll [here](https://jekyllrb.com/).  

Clone this reposity and cd in to it.
```shell
$~/Desktop/github
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
```

Run jekyll serve.

```shell
$~/Desktop/github/peicap.github.io
jekyll serve
```

This will start jekyll and the local server will be running on http://127.0.0.1:4000 where you can view the theme.
