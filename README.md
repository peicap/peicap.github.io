> A collection of new knowledge in web development as an intern. 

This project will be used as a journal to record my learning career as an intern in [insert company here] under Mr./Mrs [insert name here]. You can grab a copy and use it in anyway you like.

## Installing / Getting started
If you're using windows [this](jekyll-windows.juthilo.com) is what I follow to correctly install Jekyll on windows otherwise download and install Jekyll [here](https://jekyllrb.com/).  

Clone this reposity and cd in to it.
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/peicap/peicap.github.io.git
```
