Today I will be recording my tasks building a small business that I can get profit off. 

What I have in mind is selling people cheap services to build a website. I can use Jekyll to build site and host it on [Github](https://github.com) then use [siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/) as a CMS for customers. For building and styling I'll use ready to use jekyll themes that can be found at [jekyllthemes](http://jekyllthemes.org/). 

Payments can be made thru smart padala or any wire transfer service that is available in the Philippines. I'll start with 300Php or 6$ per site and another 50Php or 2$ per service if there's any addon.

I'll name this project Wolf Tech PH.
