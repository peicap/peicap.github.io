I'm a self taught web developer, I started learning web development watching Youtube videos and taking free online courses like CodeAcademy, TeamTreehouse etc. I also know how to work with Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to create web and graphic designs. I can also work well with different programs like MS word, excel, etc. for creating reports, data and other office related tasks. 

This year (2017), I'm learning Python for web scraping, data extraction and filtering. I have an obsession with simplicity that's why I support and love static websites that's why I use Jekyll (Static Site Generator)  whenever there is a new project I'm working on. I have worked/made lots of different projects, websites, web designs and even creating my own clothing line just to try new stuff everyday.

I've been freelancing since 2015 and have been getting different jobs from small CSS tasks to bigger web projects. The last two big web projects I made was a real estate website for two different companies and a project for my hometown's government. I work better alone but I can also manage to work with other people. I have experience in leading a project and eager to learn more everyday. I'm looking for a company and have a long-term, stable job where I can contribute, help and share my passion for technology.
