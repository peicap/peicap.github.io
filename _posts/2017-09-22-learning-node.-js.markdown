# Node.js
> Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. 

We will try to learn the basics of node.js in this post. We'll talk about what, why and how it works and how to install it. We're also gonna try to build our own simple module using node.js and publish it 

## Installing / Getting started
> Using an acer laptop (e5-573) with Windows 7 while doing the installation.


To get started first open up a browser and go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and download the version LTS which is recommended for most users. Proceed with the installation and open cmd/terminal.

Run this code to make sure we have node.js installed properly and is working.
```
$ node -v
```

This will show the nodejs version that you installed. It should be 6.11.2 or higher.
